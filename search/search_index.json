New Project \u00b6 To start off, create a folder in which you'd like the bot to reside in: mkdir SwiftcordBot cd SwiftcordBot This creates a folder named SwiftcordBot and moves you to it. Once you are in this folder, you can initialize a new Swift project by using: swift package init --type executable By default, this command will create a Swift executable project which will include a Package.swift file. Open this in your favourite text editor and add Swiftcord as a dependency. Take a look at this example Package.swift . // swift-tools-version: 5.3 import PackageDescription let package = Package( name: \"yourswiftexecutablehere\", dependencies: [ .package(url: \"https://github.com/SketchMaster2001/Swiftcord\", .branch(\"master\")) ], targets: [ .target( name: \"yourswiftexecutablehere\", dependencies: [\"Swiftcord\"] ) ] ) Note After the package url, the branch master is listed which means you will always have the latest changes applied.
